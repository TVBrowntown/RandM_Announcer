Rick and Morty Announcer Pack for Warhammer Online.
 
WHAT CAN IT DO?
 
During scenarios Rick and Morty will occassionally...
	- Announce the start of the game.
	- Respond to your death.
	- Announce your building killstreaks.
	- Share their thoughts on your current target.
	- Summarize how they feel at the end of the game.

HOW DO THE KILLSTREAKS WORK?

Kill a member of the enemy faction to build up your killstreak. You must kill again within 30 seconds to proceed to the next killstreak. Each time Rick and Morty will respond and announce your skillz to the world.
	
HOW WAS THIS DONE?

After looking at the UnrealDBAnnouncer pack I thought it would definitely be possible to improve upon this. Knowing that there was a very decent Rick and Morty Announcer Pack made for DOTA2 I got to work bringing a majority of it to ROR. Now, I'm not the best at lua and used this as a learning opportunity. I tried to tidy up my script as much as possible to not be as resource sucking as possible but I'm not perfect.

If you see any glaring issues or potential ways to improve this script please contact me at shitdev@outlook.com - I appreciate any and all feedback.

HOW TO INSTALL:
	
	1. Place the folders into your Warhammer Online folder (with your WAR.exe and WAR-64.exe)
 
	2. Open the logs folder and use the RandM_Announcer.exe while you play.
	
gg, ez.
